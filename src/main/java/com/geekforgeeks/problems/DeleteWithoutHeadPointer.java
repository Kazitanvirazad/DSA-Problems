/**
 * You are given a node del_node of a Singly Linked List where you have to delete a value of the given node
 * from the linked list but you are not given the head of the list.
 *
 * By deleting the node value, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:
 *
 * The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
 * The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
 * All the values before & after the del_node node should be in the same order.
 * Note:
 *
 * Multiple nodes can have the same values as the del_node, but you must only remove the node whose pointer
 * del_node is given to you.
 * It is guaranteed that there exists a node with a value equal to the del_node value and it will not be
 * the last node of the linked list.
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: Linked List = 1 -> 2, del_node = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: After deleting 1 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 2.
 *
 * Input: Linked List = 10 -> 20 -> 4 -> 30, del_node = 20
 * Output: 10->4->30
 * Explanation: After deleting 20 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 10, 4, 30.
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
 * Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1).
